This is a variant of tic-tac-toe, where you have 36 spaces instead of 9. You must get six tokens in a row, column, or diagonal to win! You're playing against a player, and you can place two tokens at once.

This game was built using Unity 5 and the Unity API, completely out of primitive cubes and capsules. Primitive UI elements were used, as well as a particle system for both prefabricated tokens to be used by the players.

The coding for the gaming logic, animation, and responding to clicks was done using C#, programmed on Microsoft Visual Studio 2015. See the Devpost posting for more details.
